## Hi there 👋

I'm **WaybackLinux** — a curious mind blending creativity with code! 🧠⚙️  
From low-level logic to high-level UI, I speak fluent **byte** and dream in **pixels**.  

### 💻 Languages I wield (from hardcore to high-style):
- 🧬 **Assembly** to dive deep into the metal  
- ⚙️ **C / C++ / C#** for performance & control  
- 🐍 **Python** for scripts, bots, and fun  
- 🌐 **HTML / CSS / JS** to shape the web’s look & feel  
- ☕ **Java** (yep, even that beast)  
- ⚡ **Bash** & **PowerShell** to rule the terminal  

> _“From C# to CSS — I bend code to my will.”_ 🔥  

### 🛠️ What I'm crafting:
- ✨ Custom Linux setups (Zorin, Endeavour, you name it!)
- 🧨 Wild bootloaders that talk to you (literally, ASCII style)
- 🎨 Fun little UIs in Tkinter & C#
- 🧪 Hacky tools just to see what breaks (and then fix 'em better)

### 🌌 My code = My playground.
If it runs, I’ll tweak it. If it breaks, I’ll learn from it. If it shines, I’ll share it. 🚀

Let’s turn ideas into reality, one line at a time. ⭐
